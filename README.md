teamliquid_streamer_graph=========A simple collection of scripts (being worked on) which grabs[TeamLiquid](http://www.teamliquid.net) stream data and store it in a convenient format.  The python scripts are usedfor all the data mining, and the PHP scripts can be used to present thisdata on the web.  A hosted version (linked below) can be used as a simpleAPI for TeamLiquid in lieu of having to host these scripts yourself.* [hosted API](http://pe.nitrated.net/) -- hosted version of `teamliquid_streamer_graph`* [pretty graph](http://pe.nitrated.net/graph/) -- the pretty graph generated by this application* [dcchut](http://dcc.nitrated.net/) -- my personal site
