peweb=========A simple collection of scripts (being worked on) which grabs TeamLiquidstream data and store it in a convenient format.  The python scripts are usedfor all the data mining, and the PHP scripts can be used to present thisdata on the web.  A hosted version (linked below) can be used as a simpleAPI for TeamLiquid in lieu of having to host these scripts yourself.[hosted API](http://pe.nitrated.net/) -- hosted version of `peweb`[contact](http://dcc.nitrated.net/) -- my personal site
